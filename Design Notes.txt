Star Points and Level
    Makes getting levels much quicker & easier
    Personally, more levels = more BP = more fun, and I don't care about lower difficulty

        Consequences

Coins & Consumable Items
    Encourages team play, eg. P1 farms money so P2 can buy items so P3 can survive their battle
        Start with Strange Sack to mitigate space concerns
        Could inventory be expanded further? 10 slots per player?

LevelUp Stat Choices
    More per-player customisation
        If too hard to implement, pick BP every time and provide free HP+ and FP+ badges for per-player reconfiguring

Equipped Badges
    Allow all players to customise playstyle individually

Current HP & FP & SP
    Prevents utter chaos. Otherwise 1 unfortunate player could cause a teamwipe

Non-Coop Side Features

Remove/Shorten cutscenes where possible

Rework story progression to use more specific flags. Nightmare task I'm sure.

Soften penalty for death (where possible). Dying in battle triggers a successful "run away" leaving you at 1HP
    Wouldn't work for inescapable battles, or environmental hazards, but that's probably fine

Start with full Tattle Log
    Feeling obligated to Tattle every enemy would hurt replayability

Start with full Badge List and Recipe List (and filled Map)
    Would just be nice, and doesn't affect anything anyway

Starting badges: Timing Tutor, Double Pain, Slow Go, L/W Emblem, Attack FX G/P/Y
    Badges with purely subjective benefit
